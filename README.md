# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

I will use this repository to implement various reinforcement learning algorithms, because I'm sick of reading them but not really *getting* them. Hence, hopefully this repository will help me understand them better. I will also implement various supporting code as needed, such as for simple custom scenarios like GridWorld. Or I can use OpenAI gym. Click on the links to get to the appropriate repositories.

Here are the algorithms which I already know quite well (not in this repository):

- Value Iteration and Policy Iteration
- SARSA, tabular version
- Q-Learning with linear function approximation (implemented in closed-source code, sorry)
- Deep Q-Networks, vanilla version (understood via [spragnur's deep_q_rl code](https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl) as well as [my personal fork](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/deep_q_rl))

Here are the algorithms currently implemented or in progress:

- [Q-Learning, tabular version](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/q_learning) (should be correct)
- [G-Learning](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/g_learning) (currently verifying)
- Learning with Options

# References

I have read a number of reinforcement learning paper references to help me out. A list of papers and summaries (for a few of them) are [in my paper notes repository](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).
