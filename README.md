# Reinforcement Learning Algorithms

I will use this repository to implement various reinforcement learning
algorithms, because I'm sick of reading them but not really *getting* them.
Hence, hopefully this repository will help me understand them better. I will
also implement various supporting code as needed, such as for simple custom
scenarios like GridWorld. Or I can use OpenAI gym. Click on the links to get to
the appropriate algorithms. Each sub-directory will have its own READMEs with
results there, along with usage instructions.

Here are the algorithms currently implemented or in progress:

- [Q-Learning, tabular version](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/q_learning) (should be correct)
- [G-Learning](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/g_learning) (WIP)
- [Deep-Q Networks](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/dqn) (should be correct)
- [Behavioral Cloning](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/il) (WIP)
- [Natural Evolution Strategies](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/es) (should be correct)
- [Vanilla Policy Gradients](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/vpg) (should be correct)
- [Trust Region Policy Optimization](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/rl_algorithms/tree/master/trpo) (WIP)

# GPU and TensorFlow

I installed TensorFlow 1.0.1 from source.  For the configuration script, I used
CUDA 8.0, cuDNN 5.1.5, and compute capability 6.1.

Compiling from source means I can get faster CPU instructions. This requires
`bazel` plus extra compiler options. I used:

```
bazel build -c opt --copt=-mavx --copt=-mavx2 --copt=-mfma --copt=-mfpmath=both --copt=-msse4.2 --config=opt --config=cuda //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
```

This resulted in ton of warning messages but I ended up with:

```
Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package
INFO: Elapsed time: 884.276s, Critical Path: 672.19s
```

and things seem to be working. Then run the command:

```
bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
```

To get a wheel, which we then do a pip install. But be careful due to pip on
anaconda vs pip with default python. I use anaconda. And make sure you're not in
either the `tensorflow` or the `bazel` directories!

Track the GPU usage with `nvidia-smi`. Unfortunately, that's only for one
time-step, but we can instead run:

```
while true; do nvidia-smi --query-gpu=utilization.gpu --format=csv >> gpu_utilization.log; sleep 10; done;
```

Or something like that. It will record the output every 10 seconds and dump it
into the log file. Ideally, GPU usage should be as high as possible (100% or
close to it).

# References

I have read a number of reinforcement learning paper references to help me out.
A list of papers and summaries (for a few of them) are [in my paper notes
repository](https://github.com/DanielTakeshi/Paper_Notes).
