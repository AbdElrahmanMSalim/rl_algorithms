"""
Code for basic tabular Q-learning. This is adapted from Denny Britz's repository.

Observations for the **cliff_walking** scenario:

- I was confused why the agent always seemed to go up at the start. But then I
  found out it's because np.argmax(Q[observation]) will return the leading
  index, and at the start, it's 0 all the way, so it always picks the first one
  which is to go up (see cliff_walking.py). It's a little annoying but not a big
  deal, it works out in the end.

- The policy_fn will return one 0.925 and three 0.025s, since it will pick the
  best action and *then* adjust for epsilons. If I want to see how the Q-values
  are evolving, I need to use Q[observation] directly, not A.

- To print, use env.render(). Very useful for the grid-like settings.

- There's no extra reward for the goal state. It's just -1 for all R(s,a,s')
  unless the successor (new_position in the code) is the cliff, in which case
  it's -100.

Other observations:

- This code is general so it doesn't have to be cliff-walking, **but** you have
  to be careful to use an environment that gives a single number as a state, not
  a continuous state (e.g., unfortunately CartPole wouldn't work here). I can
  use FrozenLake-v0 but even a 4x4 space requires 10k or so iterations to see
  improvement.

- At the end, it uses the plotting script, but I should probably roll out a
  modified verison for my own use.
