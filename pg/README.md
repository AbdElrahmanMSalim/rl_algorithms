# Policy Gradients

This repository started out as the homework assignment from CS 294-112, Deep
Reinforcement Learning, at UC Berkeley. See `cs294-112_stuff/homework.md` for
details. Here's the first figure they wanted:

I think it looks good. Their "-300" requirement for the reward is a bit unclear.
The performance seems to reach that level but sometimes dips below. I ran this
with the default settings, except for increasing the number of iterations from
300 to 500.
